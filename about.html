      Our idea Stripped Pizza was founded in 2016 in Zurich with the mission: to
      provide pizza as a wholesome meal without additives, flavor enhancers and
      dyes. That's where our name "Stripped" comes from: free of any additives.
      The recipes are self-created to ensure that each pizza is also balanced
      and wholesome. That means high levels of fiber, nutrients, proteins and
      vitamins. We continually develop our dishes so that they are even more
      wholesome. For example, we enrich our pizzas with vegetables whenever
      possible. We are also very concerned about quality. The ingredients are
      always fresh, of high quality and are carefully prepared by hand.

      The dough as well as the sauce are prepared daily on site according to our
      own recipe. Our dough matures for 48 hours so that it is nice and airy and
      also more digestible. We currently offer four different doughs. Multigrain
      dough for lovers of "traditional" pizza dough. Whole wheat dough with
      flaxseed for prudent gourmets. Gluten-free dough for foodies with gluten
      intolerance. And a new broccoli dough, which consists of one third fresh
      broccoli, for those who prefer a full-flavored pizza base. Whether vegans,
      athletes, allergy sufferers or omnivores - it is important to us that
      everyone receives a wholesome meal with us. Therefore, we offer a variety
      of different pizzas and of course there is the possibility to compose your
      pizza according to your own wishes. In addition to our passion for good
      food, we care about health and well-being in general. So we cooperate with
      various yoga studios, support football clubs, make ourselves strong for
      the Cancer League and offer space for creative courses.
